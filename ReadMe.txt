All the scripts were developed on MATLAB 2023a.

This file contains two main scripts:
	- CoherentBasis.m
	- FockBasis.m	
which define two types of classes. The first one, CoherentBasis.m , refers to Coherent states basis 
of Qunatum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO), while the second, FockBasis.m, refers to the number/Fock states 
of QHO.

The file also includes four examples, one for each case,
	- CoherentBasis_Example_1.m
	- FockBasis_Example_1.m
	- Q_Function_CoherentBasis_Example.m
	- Q_function_FockBasis_Example.m
	
that help the user explore the features of the two main classes. 

The key feature of these two classes (CoherentBasis, and FockBasis) is that they can compute the 
Wigner Distribution (Quasi-Probability distribution) for any given state. However, they also include 
other useful features such as state addition, normalization, Displacement operations etc.

This is the very first version and I intend to incorporate more features. Some of them are 
	- time evolution 
	- plot number states in Ηarmonic potential
	- switch between the two basεs (connect the two classes somehow)

	- Introductory Quantum Optics. Christopher Gerry Peter Knight

I am open to other suggestions. Please feel free to contact me.  

Any feedback and suggestions are much appreciated!
